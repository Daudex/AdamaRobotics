Robotics as a Learning Platform
The Adama Robotics kit was designed to be the ultimate robot for teaching, learning, hacking, and research for beginners. It is perfect for those just getting started in programming and Robotics automation research.
The Adama Kit will give you endless opportunities to hack the DIY world. It is combined with Arduino Microcontroller and the Sensors.

Good Hardware and Gear Motors
The Adama Kit is built using high quality components. The pan/tilt head assembly, motor mounts, servo mounts, and connecting hardware are stamped metal parts for maximum durability. 

Easy Access to Ports

Assembled from a Kit
The Adama Kit is shipped as you will assemble yourself with basic hand tools. We will populate all the electronic parts on the boards so no soldering is necessary. Assembly hardware and parts are included.
